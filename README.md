# BinaryHexadecimalConverter

This project is implemented to be able to convert numbers from Denary,Hexadecimal and Binary
Implemented to help practise Python as well as course work
Attempting and Using new techniques, such as implementing switch case in python
Aiming for efficient code

NOTE : In some cases, I could have reduced the code needed  by reusing already made code
I decided against doing this to better understand the conversion happening, rather than just using 1 conversion
For instance, to convert binary to hex, I could have converted the binary number to denary and then the denary number to hex. I decided against doing this to better understand what is happening.
